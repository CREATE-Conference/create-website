    text: "When looking back on my high school experiences, I remember a lot of fond things from CREATE. It was an opportunity to see new places, try new things, and (most importantly) foster genuine human connections. I say that because going to CREATE as a delegate helped me get closer to a lot of the friends I have today. I loved the experience so much and I decided to become a maven, unknowing how much it was going to affect my future. Being a creative worker in the industry of photography, I've learned that the best photographers are not only great at taking photos but great at interacting with people. CREATE taught me to be a lot more outgoing, and is honestly a huge contributor to the interpersonal skills I have today. Whenever I get comments about being such a friendly photographer, I attribute a lot of the credit to the habits I picked up at CREATE.",

The camp allowed me to meet dozens of people I would normally have never spoken to, but who to this day remain close friends of mine. I credit much of my development as a leader to every minute I spent at CREATE, from campfires to team cheers to staying up past midnight doing spicy ramen challenges with my roommates (then waking up extra early as a result, yikes), the memories I shared with all my fellow mavens and delegates hold a special place in my heart. CREATE offers a completely safe and comfortable space for shy and outgoing people alike to develop as leaders, which is why 9/10 dentists recommend CREATE for a brighter smile. üòâ",

This experience exceeded my expectations, and so much more. Not only did I get to make unique memories with an amazing group of people, I learned a lot about being a successful and well-rounded student, friend, and leader. At the start of the weekend, I was a bit shy as it seemed like everyone else had already known each other for years. In reality, the council environment was very welcoming and inclusive, and I had made good friends within the first few hours. I also really enjoyed the case competition activity, as it taught me more about myself, my strengths and my weaknesses, and how to collaborate with others. The ‚ÄúWhat's in the box‚Äù activity was a super fun way to get everyone to open up to each other. I would definitely recommend CREATE, not just to Markham-located students, looking for a very enriching opportunity to build character.",

Now thinking back, we were super sweaty and tired, but it was quite funny how everyone looked like a swarm of minions scattered around on the field haha. CREATE taught me so much about not being afraid to reach out to people because everyone is super duper friendly and kind (don't worry, people are not as scary as you may think) üòÅ. In fact, I am probably still that one timid and shy girl, but deep down inside my heart, I got little more courage.

          "hi there everyone! i'm christar and super thrilled to be this years co-president alongside the wonderful, the beautiful, ms summer chu!! this is my fourth and final year on CREATE & let me tell you, it's been a journey (shoutout team 7 up, team 7 deadpool, team 8 arthur & team 15 fruit ninja ily all) create holds such a special place in my heart, from all the cozy memories to the inside jokes, and even though i can't promise you'll have a good time, i can promise you'll get longer breaks during online conference this year.",
          "nonetheless in my free time you can catch me watching anime (drop recs pls), taking 16 hour naps (which is why i don't respond) or listening to rnb music (my friends never give me the aux though). i can chug a bottle of water in under 10 seconds and i'm the best driver in my friendgroup (i'm not g2 bound yet but i will claim this title).",
          "despite conference being online, we hope each and every one of you join our create family and hopefully get a chance to experience the real taste of create (in person) at retreat. anyways catch flights not feels üí™ test negative but stay positive üòπ. my lovely team & i can't wait for you to see what we have in store this year, so stay tuned!",

Over the past couple of months, I've had the pleasure to work with my fellow execs and let me tell you, they are AMAZING people, and I'm super excited to show all of you what we have planned for this year's CREATE conference! The conference is an awesome opportunity for you to make new friends, discover more about yourself, and most importantly, have lots of FUN! Speaking of which, here are some of my hobbies that will hopefully help you get to know me better! During my free time, I enjoy coding, playing (and coaching) tennis, drinking bubble tea, and listening to music! That being said, if you ever come across me, feel free to talk to me! Whether it be questions about CREATE, music recommendations, or just a casual chat, I'd love to get to know you better! On a final note, CREATE is an incredible event, and I am so excited to see all your beautiful faces there! :)",
